## Workflow

## Goal 1 - Reproducing and Improving a Plot

### Original Plot Indicating Chemical Concentrations during Hurricane Hugo

![](images/luq-ts-plot.png){width="3.89in" height="2.18in"}

### Recreated Plot

![](images/hugo_plot_1.png){width="399"}

### Improvements on Plot 1

Upon reading the scientific paper, our team found out that the chemical concentrations were measured over 9 weeks, therefore we graphed over 9 week moving averages.

## Goal 2 - Posing our Own Question

### Can temperature patterns be identified in Puerto Rico during hurricane season from years 2015 to 2019?
